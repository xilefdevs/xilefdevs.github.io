          My love, Marisol, <br /><br />
          Being able to live every day as your partner has cultivated such an
          indescribable feeling in me. Maybe it could be described better as a
          force, a reaction so divine that am too mortal to fathom. I love you
          in such a way that has changed my being entirely, and to develop and
          grow in your image is the greatest opportunity my life has seen.
          Nothing will ever reach me as you have, nothing in this existence
          could begin to compare to the way your name swells in my chest, dances
          in my thoughts, or falls from my lips. Your absence proves bittersweet
          in this moment, as I am writing these words to you in hopes that it
          will quicken these moments where my side is without your warmth and my
          eyes are blind without your light. Even so, I appreciate these very
          moments where I may dwell on your absence and hope that you feel how I
          ache for you.
          <br /><br />
          Yours eternally, <br /><br />
          Felix <br /><br />
